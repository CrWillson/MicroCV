## Installation Instructions
### Requirements
This project was tested using:

| **Dependency**               	| **Version**          	| **Download/Instructions** 	
|:------------------------------|:----------------------|:-
| **gcc**                      	| 14.2.0            	| [Instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-c-and-cpp-compiler-on-windows/)
| **cmake**                    	| 3.24.0            	| [Download](https://cmake.org/download/)

| **ESP-IDF VSCode extension** 	| v1.8.1            	| [Installer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension)
| **ESP-IDF Tools**            	| v5.3.1            	| [Download](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html)

Note that this project may work with older or newer versions of these dependencies. 
These are only the versions project was tested with.

**The C++ and CMake VSCode extensions are also necessary.**

> GCC, Cmake, and git should be installed with the default options to ensure the greatest chance of compatability.
> Any custom settings in these programs have not been tested or documented.

### ESP-IDF Tools Setup
To set up the ESP-IDF toolchain:

1. Download the ESP-IDF Tools Installer listed above.
2. Scroll down to where you see `ESP-IDF Tools Installer` and click on the link labled `Windows Installer Download`.
3. Click the top download link labled `Universal Online Installer` and run the installer.
4. Continue through the installer and keep the default options and filepaths.
    > When you reach the **Version of ESP-IDF** selection, make sure **v5.3.1 (release version -.zip archive download)** is selected.
    
    > When you reach the **Select Components** page, make sure **Full installation** is selected.

5. Finish the installation.

If all of the options were kept as the default, there should be two important filepaths to remember:
```(bash)
C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.3.1-2
C:\Users\USERNAME\.espressif
```

### ESP-IDF VSCode Extension Setup
To set up the ESP-IDF VSCode extension:

1. Install the ESP-IDF extension from the link above or VSCode's extension manager.
2. If the configure page does not automatically open, select the new ESP-IDF icon on the lefthand column then select `Configure ESP-IDF Extension` in the lefthand commands menu. 
3. Select `Express`.
4. Enter the following options:
    * Select download server: **Github**
    * Select ESP-IDFF version: **Find ESP-IDF in your system**
    * Enter ESP-IDF directory (IDF_PATH): **C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.3.1-2**
    * Enter ESP-IDF Tools directory (IDF_TOOLS_PATH): **C:\Users\USERNAME\\.espressif**
4. Select `Install` and wait until you see a menu saying `Quick actions`.
5. Make sure the ESP32-Cam is plugged into the computer.
6. On the settings bar along the bottom of the window, do the following:
    1. Select the icon of a plug and chose the USB port that the ESP32-Cam is plugged into. It should auto detect the ESP32 and suggest which one to use but it might not.
    2. Select the star icon and choose the `UART` flash method. 
    3. Select the wrench icon to begin the initial build.

 If the project fails to build, try the following:
 * Check that CMake is using the right generator:
   * Enter the VSCode command menu (Default Key: F1)
   * Enter the command: `CMake: Open Cmake Tools Extension Settings`
   * Search for the setting: `CMake: Generator`
   * Enter `Ninja` into the setting.
   * Press enter to save the setting.
* Delete the build directory:
    * You can either do this by selecting the trash can icon on the bottom settings bar or by manually deleting the build folder in the top level directory.
    * In general, if the project fails to build, this is usually a good first step.

Settle in. *The first build will take a while*.

Once the first build has finished, it can be flashed to the ESP32-Cam using the lightning bolt button on the bottom settings bar.
